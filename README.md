# Hi, I'm Anna Barnes 👋

I'm a software engineer guided by **Code**, **Kindness**, and **Curiosity** — principles that shape how I build software, collaborate with others, and grow in my craft.

I specialize in backend systems built with Go and Python, modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue.js, and system integrations that make real-world tools feel seamless. My superpower? Debugging the tricky stuff no one else wants to touch — especially across legacy boundaries, real-time systems, and distributed services.

## 💼 What I’ve Worked On

- 🟢 Modernized a legacy waitlist system at Topgolf by leading the transition from a C#/WPF desktop app to a responsive Vue.js front end
- ⚙️ Designed and implemented scalable APIs using Go and Python, with OpenAPI documentation for smooth cross-team onboarding
- 🧠 Pioneered AI-assisted dev practices: test generation, smarter code reviews, and documentation support
- 📲 Integrated Apple Wallet into a high-throughput loyalty platform at NCR, boosting mobile engagement
- 🤝 Mentored junior devs through pair programming, architecture reviews, and code quality conversations

## 🛠 What I’m Currently Exploring

- 🔊 [Loqa](https://github.com/annabarnes1138/loqa-voice-assistant): a local-first voice assistant combining ESP32 hardware, real-time backend inference, and on-device wake word detection via Edge Impulse and PlatformIO
- 🚗 Embedded systems and real-time software for mobility platforms (think SDVs, CAN protocols, and OpenPilot deep dives)
- 🧩 Clean architecture and service boundaries across cloud and edge
- 🤖 AI-assisted developer workflows and real-world agent behavior
- 🐶 Miniature schnauzers (my unofficial QA team and emotional support engineers)

---

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I'm actively exploring mid-to-senior engineering roles — especially where backend systems meet embedded software, voice interfaces, or applied AI. Open to hybrid roles near Dallas or fully remote opportunities.
