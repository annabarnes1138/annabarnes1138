# Hi, I'm Anna Barnes 👋

I'm a software engineer guided by **Code**, **Kindness**, and **Curiosity** — principles that shape how I build software, collaborate with others, and grow in my craft.

I specialize in backend systems built with **Go** and **Python**, modern frontends with **Vue.js**, and systems integration across real-time, legacy, and distributed environments. My superpower? **Debugging the stuff no one else wants to touch** — especially at the seams between hardware and software, or cloud and edge.

## 💼 What I’ve Worked On

- 🟢 Modernized a legacy waitlist system at Topgolf by leading the transition from a C#/WPF desktop app to a responsive Vue.js front end  
- ⚙️ Designed and implemented scalable APIs using Go and Python, with OpenAPI docs for smooth cross-team onboarding  
- 🤖 Piloted GenAI-assisted dev practices: test generation, smarter code reviews, and knowledge capture  
- 📲 Integrated Apple Wallet into a high-throughput loyalty platform at NCR, boosting mobile engagement  
- 🤝 Mentored junior devs through pair programming, architecture discussions, and debugging marathons

## 🛠 What I’m Currently Exploring

### 🔊 [Loqa](https://github.com/loqalabs/loqa) — A Local-First Voice Assistant

A privacy-first smart home voice assistant designed to run entirely offline:

- ESP32-based hardware pucks with wake word detection (Edge Impulse)  
- Real-time audio streaming over gRPC to a local hub  
- Whisper.cpp for STT and Llama 3 (via Ollama) for intent parsing  
- Event-driven architecture with NATS and modular Dockerized services  
- Roadmap: Zigbee/HomeKit integration, conversation memory, and ESP32 firmware  

### Other Interests

- 🚗 Embedded systems for mobility: SDVs, CAN protocols, OpenPilot deep dives  
- 🧩 Clean service boundaries across cloud and edge  
- 🤖 Real-world agent behavior and AI-assisted dev workflows  
- 🐶 Miniature schnauzers (QA interns + bark-driven deployment alerts)

## 🤝 Let’s Connect

I'm actively exploring **senior software engineering roles** — especially where backend systems meet **embedded platforms**, **voice interfaces**, or **applied AI**. Currently targeting **fully remote** roles only.
