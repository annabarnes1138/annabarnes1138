# 👋 Hi, I'm Anna Barnes

I'm a software engineer guided by **Code, Kindness, and Curiosity** — principles that shape how I build software, collaborate with others, and grow in my craft.

I have a strong foundation in **Python, C#, Go, REST APIs**, and modern JavaScript frameworks like **Vue.js** and **Node.js**. I specialize in integrating systems, modernizing legacy codebases, and — most of all — **debugging the tricky issues others avoid**.

---

## 🛠️ What I’ve Been Working On  
– Modernized a legacy waitlist system at **Topgolf**, leading the migration from a C#/WPF desktop app to a responsive Vue.js web platform  
– Designed and implemented scalable APIs using Go and Python, with OpenAPI documentation for smooth onboarding and cross-team clarity  
– Led the adoption of AI-assisted dev practices for better code reviews, test coverage, and developer productivity  
– Integrated Apple Wallet into a high-throughput loyalty platform at **NCR**, boosting mobile engagement  
– Mentored junior developers through pair programming, constructive feedback, and collaborative architecture discussions  

---

## 💡 What I’m All About  
– Designing clean, resilient software that serves *people*, not just systems  
– Collaborating with empathy and clarity in Agile teams  
– Creating inclusive, curiosity-driven dev environments  
– Exploring how AI and automation can improve development workflows  
– Miniature schnauzers (my three furry QA engineers 🐶)

---

## 🚗 Tech on Wheels  
I'm especially interested in the intersection of **software and vehicles** — from diagnostics and real-time systems to embedded and autonomous tech. I've been exploring embedded programming in **C, C++, and Rust**, studying CAN protocols, and digging into open-source platforms like [OpenPilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot) to better understand **ADAS and real-time mobility software**.

---

## 🔍 Currently Exploring  
– Embedded systems and real-time software  
– Automotive tech stacks and connected mobility  
– AI-assisted developer tooling  
– Clean architecture across service boundaries  

---

## 📫 Let’s Connect  
I’m actively exploring new opportunities and always open to conversations about **human-centered software, embedded tech, and curious problem-solving**.
