# 👋 Hi, I'm Anna Barnes

I'm a software engineer guided by **Code, Kindness, and Curiosity** — principles that shape how I build software, collaborate with others, and grow in my craft.

With a strong foundation in **Python, C#, Go, REST APIs**, and modern JavaScript frameworks like **Vue.js**, I thrive on making complex systems work well together. I enjoy tackling legacy modernization, solving integration challenges, and — most of all — **debugging the tricky issues others avoid**.

---

## 🛠️ What I’ve Been Working On  
- Modernized a legacy waitlist system at **Topgolf**, transitioning from a C#/WPF desktop app to a Vue.js web platform  
- Led the adoption of AI-assisted dev practices for cleaner code reviews and better test coverage  
- Integrated Apple Wallet into a high-volume loyalty platform at **NCR**, improving customer experience  
- Mentored junior developers through pair programming, thoughtful feedback, and knowledge sharing  

---

## 💡 What I’m All About  
- Designing clean, resilient software that serves *people*, not just systems  
- Collaborating with empathy and clarity  
- Creating inclusive, curiosity-driven dev environments  
- Exploring how AI and automation can make development smarter and more accessible  
- Miniature schnauzers (my three furry QA engineers 🐶)

---

## 🚗 Tech on Wheels  
I'm especially curious about the intersection of **vehicles and software** — from diagnostics and real-time data to autonomous systems. I’ve been exploring embedded programming in **C and Rust**, digging into open-source platforms like [OpenPilot](https://github.com/commaai/openpilot), and learning how software can shape the future of **mobility, safety, and driver experience**.

---

## 🔍 Currently Exploring  
- Embedded systems and real-time software  
- Automotive tech stacks and CAN data  
- AI-powered developer tooling  
- Clean architecture across system boundaries  

---

## 📫 Let’s Connect  
I’m actively exploring new opportunities and always open to conversations about **human-centered software, embedded tech, and curious problem-solving**.
